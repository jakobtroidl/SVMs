function w = percTrain(X, t, maxIts, online)
% Returns a weight vector w corresponding to the decision boundary
% separating the input vectors in X according to their target values t.
%
% The argument maxIts determines an upper limit for iterations of the
% gradient based optimization procedure. If this upper limit is reached
% before a solution vector is found, the function returns the current w,
% otherwise it returns the solution weight vector. online is true if the
% online-version of the optimization procedure is to be used or false for
% the batch-version.
